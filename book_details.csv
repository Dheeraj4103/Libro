"Network Simulation Experiments Manual","Emad Aboelela","Network Simulation Experiments Manual, Third Edition, is a practical tool containing detailed, simulation-based experiments to help students and professionals learn about key concepts in computer networking. It allows the networking professional to visualize how computer networks work with the aid of a software tool called OPNET to simulate network function. OPNET provides a virtual environment for modeling, analyzing, and predicting the performance of IT infrastructures, including applications, servers, and networking technologies. It can be downloaded free of charge and is easy to install. The book’s simulation approach provides a virtual environment for a wide range of desirable features, such as modeling a network based on specified criteria and analyzing its performance under different scenarios. The experiments include the basics of using OPNET IT Guru Academic Edition; operation of the Ethernet network; partitioning of a physical network into separate logical networks using virtual local area networks (VLANs); and the basics of network design. Also covered are congestion control algorithms implemented by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP); the effects of various queuing disciplines on packet delivery and delay for different services; and the role of firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs) in providing security to shared public networks. Each experiment in this updated edition is accompanied by review questions, a lab report, and exercises. Networking designers and professionals as well as graduate students will find this manual extremely helpful. Updated and expanded by an instructor who has used OPNET simulation tools in his classroom for numerous demonstrations and real-world scenarios. Software download based on an award-winning product made by OPNET Technologies, Inc., whose software is used by thousands of commercial and government organizations worldwide, and by over 500 universities. Useful experimentation for professionals in the workplace who are interested in learning and demonstrating the capability of evaluating different commercial networking products, i.e., Cisco routers.

"Calculus for Computer Graphics","John Vince","Students studying different branches of computer graphics need to be familiar with geometry, matrices, vectors, rotation transforms, quaternions, curves and surfaces. And as computer graphics software becomes increasingly sophisticated, calculus is also being used to resolve its associated problems. In this 3rd edition, the author extends the scope of the original book to include vector differential operators and differential equations and draws upon his experience in teaching mathematics to undergraduates to make calculus appear no more challenging than any other branch of mathematics. He introduces the subject by examining how functions depend upon their independent variables, and then derives the appropriate mathematical underpinning and definitions. This gives rise to a function’s derivative and its antiderivative, or integral. Using the idea of limits, the reader is introduced to derivatives and integrals of many common functions. Other chapters address higher-order derivatives, partial derivatives, Jacobians, vector-based functions, single, double and triple integrals, with numerous worked examples and almost two hundred colour illustrations. This book complements the author’s other books on mathematics for computer graphics and assumes that the reader is familiar with everyday algebra, trigonometry, vectors and determinants. After studying this book, the reader should understand calculus and its application within the world of computer graphics, games and animation.","Rating not available","9783031281174",1
